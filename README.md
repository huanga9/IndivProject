# The Roomate Application

Description: When making the transition to college life, learning to live with a roommate is often one of the biggest adjustments that students living on campus are faced with. This system aims to cultivate a more mindful living environment by providing a means for roommates to keep track of their living obligations and to communicate about any room related issues as they arise. 

See the wiki page for the project proposal and design documents.

Main Functionality Implemented: <br>
Home Page: <br>
o	A roommate will be able to log into the system by inputting a recognized username or password. The user should also be able to create an account if they do not already have one. <br>
Rank Chores Page: <br>
o	Roommates will be able to rank a chore from 1 to 5 based on its perceived difficulty. <br>
o	The roommate will then submit his/her rankings to be stored by the system. <br>
o	Once roommates submit their chore rankings, the page will update and users can view which chores they are assigned for the week. To generate these chore assignments, an greedy algorithm will be used to partition the chores as evenly as possible (modeled below), so that each roommate is assigned not necessarily an even number of chores, but rather a set of chores that add up to the same amount of difficulty.

Future Work: <br>
o	Once a roommate has completed a chore, he/she will be able to mark that chore as complete in the system. <br>
o	Multiple users will be able to create accounts and use the site as a group.  <br>
o	Notifications Page: This will allow any user to notify the ahead of time group of important issues that arise. Updates will be posted with the most recent one at the top of the page. For example, users can post to the group about any overnight guests ahead of time as well as post if they will be away for the weekend. <br>
o	Anonymous Feedback Page: This page will allow the roommate to post anonymously about any of the issues that come up so that other roommates become aware of how their habits may affect others. However, the R.A. will be able to view the userâ€™s name to ensure that everyone is respectful in their posts. This will also give the R.A. identifying information in case any serious conflicts need to be resolved in person.
